 * Revision 1.2  2001-04-21 07:12:30  dan
 * For libwraster:
 * ---------------
 *
 * - Added retain/release mechanism to RImage by adding RRetainImage() and
 *   RReleaseImage(). RDestroyImage() is an alias to RReleaseImage() now, but
 *   will be removed in a future release because it no longer fits with the
 *   semantics. Will be kept for a while to allow a smoother transition.
 *   More about in wrlib/NEWS
 *
 *
 * For WINGs:
 * ----------
 *
 * - Small API change:
 *   1. Renamed WMSetApplicationIconImage(), WMGetApplicationIconImage() and
 *      WMSetWindowMiniwindowImage() to respectively WMSetApplicationIconPixmap(),
 *      WMGetApplicationIconPixmap() and WMSetWindowMiniwindowPixmap()
 *      They operate on a WMPixmap which is practically an X Pixmap with no alpha
 *      channel information and the new name is more suggestive and also leaves
 *      room for the new functions added for operating on images with alpha info.
 *   2. Added WMSetApplicationIconImage() and WMGetApplicationIconImage() which
 *      operate on an RImage and store alpha information too.
 *   3. Added WMGetApplicationIconBlendedPixmap() which will take the image with
 *      alpha set by WMSetApplicationIconImage() and will blend it with a color.
 *      If color is NULL it will blend using the default panel color (#aeaaae)
 *   All these changes will allow WINGs to handle images with alpha blending
 *   correctly in panels and wherever else needed. More about in WINGs/NEWS.
 * - updated panels to use the newly available RImages if present and fallback
 *   to old WMPixmaps if not, to properly show alpha blended images.
 * - replaced some still left malloc's with wmalloc's.
 *
 *
 * For Window Maker:
 * -----------------
 * - Fixed wrong mapping position of the "Docked Applications Panel" for some
 *   icons.
 * - Smoother animation for the smiley =)
 * - Made images with alpha blending be shown correctly in the panels and the
 *   icon chooser.
 * - The icon image set to be shown in panels ("Logo.WMPanel") will be
 *   automatically updated if its entry in WMWindowAttributes changes (without
 *   a need to restart as until now).
 *
 *
 * *** Note!!! ***
 *
 * If you are developing applications with one of libwraster or libWINGs
 * then you should look to wrlib/NEWS and WINGs/NEWS to see what changed
 * and how should you update your code.

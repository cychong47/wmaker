Welcome to libwmfun!

libwmfun is a library that provides function textures for WindowMaker.
WindowMaker is a popular for the X Window System (for more information,
visit www.windowmaker.org). Due to the implementation of function
textures in WindowMaker, this library must be compiled as a shared
library!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage: First make sure that your version of WindowMaker does support
function textures. The package is of no use outside of WindowMaker!

Colors are specified in the same was as for WindowMaker in its
configuration file, e.g. in a verbose mode ("blue", "red", ...) or as
triplets of hexadecimal numbers ("rgb:10/20/7f" for a dark blue).

Textures supported so far:

bilinear <color1> <color2> <color3> <color4>

  This texture provides a bilinear interpolation of the corner colors.
  <color1> is used for the upper left, <color2> for the upper right,
  <color3> for the lower left and (you dig it) <color4> for the lower
  right corner.

fade [--from <color1>] [--to <color2>]

  Vertically fade from <color1> to <color2>. This effect is similar
  to vgradient, but the fading is a bit irregular and gives a marble
  like impression.

waves [--from <color1>] [--to <color2>] <layers> <frequency>

  This effect randomly creates several sine layers and adds their
  values. Use the <layers> parameter to specify the number of layers.
  The sine layers have randomly chosen frequencies, whose range is
  specified in the second parameter. Lower frequencies yield smoother
  textures.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples:

  MenuTextBack = (
    function, libwmfun.so, fade,
    "--from", "rgb:40/60/ff",
    "--to", "rgb:ff/ff/ff"
  );

  IconBack = (
    function, libwmfun.so, bilinear,
    "rgb:ff/ff/40", "rgb:ff/60/20", "rgb:60/ff/20", "rgb:20/60/ff"
  );


Also there is included a small demo style file in the same directory where you
read this file. Its name is WMFun-demo.style. To test how it works, just type:

setstyle WMFun-demo.style

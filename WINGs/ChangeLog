changes since wmaker 0.62.1:
............................
- added WRuler widget
- added WText widget (rtf multiline text widget) 
	Nwanua Elumeze <nwanua@colorado.edu>
- added a new AUTO option for the UseMultiByte option
- added WMRaiseWidget()/WMLowerWidget()
- added missing EscapeTextMovement to textfield delegate/notification
- added WMGetLabelText()
- added WMReparentWidget()
- added WMCreateTabViewItem()
- added W_CreateUnmanagedTopView()
- added wtokenjoin(), wtokensplit(), wtokenfree(), wtrimspace()
- added WMWidgetIsMapped()
- added WMSetApplicationIconWindow()
- restructured the directory tree. Added Documentation, Examples and Tests
  subdirectories
- removed WMArrayBag and reorganized WMTreeBag to be WMBag.
- added WMArray class.
- added WMSetWindowUserPosition()
- added WMGetListSelectedItems()
- added WMSetListAllowMultipleSelection(), WMListAllowsMultipleSelection().
- added WMSetListAllowEmptySelection(), WMListAllowsEmptySelection().
- WMListSelectionDidChangeNotification passes NULL as the notification 
  client data (previously passed the selected item row).
- added WMUnselectListItem(), WMSelectAllListItems(), WMUnselectAllListItems()
- better behavior of wheel mices in WMList. Simple mouse wheel events
  will scroll by 1/3 of the WMList height. Using Shift as a modifier will
  scroll line by line, while using Control as a modifier will scroll page
  by page.
- better behavior of WMScroller regarding mouse wheel events. 'Shift' modifier
  will scroll line by line, while 'Control' modifier will scroll page by page.
- fixed some buffer overflow allowing bugs.
- added WSDecrementWheel and WSIncrementWheel for handling mouse wheel in
  scrollers and scrolled widgets. This should be treated like the WSxxxPage
  counterparts, except it should scroll by page_size/3 instead of one full page
- added WMSetBrowserAllowMultipleSelection(), WMSetBrowserAllowEmptySelection()
  WMBrowserAllowsMultipleSelection() and WMBrowserAllowsEmptySelection()
- WMBrowser now allows multiple selections.
- Added WMGetBrowserPaths() to retrieve the paths for browsers that allow
  multiple selections.
- WMDestroyWidget() now calls WMUnmapWidget() first
- added WMScrollerDidScrollNotification to scroller
- added WMGetScrollViewVisibleRect()
- fixed a mem leak in the browser code.
- renamed wstrappend() to wstrconcat(). wstrconcat(str1, str2) concatenates
  str1 with str2 and returns that in a newly malloc'ed string.
  Be sure to rename wstrappend with wstrconcat in your code too, else
  hazardous things can happen!
- implemented a new wstrappend() function. wstrappend(dst, src) will append 
  src to dst modifing dst and returning a pointer to it. No new string is 
  generated, except if dst is NULL, in which case its the same as calling
  wstrdup(src).
  dst can ONLY be NULL or a dynamically allocated string (obtained from a
  call to malloc, realloc, wmalloc, wrealloc, ...). dst CANNOT be a static
  or a constant string!
- added wmessage() for printing a variable formatted string to stderr, with
  the program name prepended to it. Similar to wwarning(), except that it
  doesn't add "warning:" in the output message.
- added WMBox widget
- added WMAddTabViewItemWithView()
- added W_SetViewCursor()
- made Extra widgets library
- added table widget in Extras library
- added WMGetConnectionUnsentData() (WMGetConnectionQueuedData() too as an
  alias).
- added WMSetConnectionCloseOnExec() to specify if the socket associated
  with a connection survives an exec* call or not. When a new connection is
  created using the WMCreate... or WMAcceptConnection() calls, it has the
  close on exec flag set automatically to 'True' by the library. Unless
  you want to let the socket of some connection to survive across an exec*
  call, you need not to call this function.
- removed all the wsyserror() and wwarning() calls from host.c and
  connection.c and replaced where appropriate with assertions. If a function
  returns some invalid result, you can still get the system error message if
  you need, by calling wsyserrorwithcode() and passing WCErrorCode, if
  WCErrorCode > 0. If WCErrorCode==0, that is not a system error, and
  wsyserrorwithcode() should not be called in this case.
- added WMNextHashEnumeratorKey() to retrieve all keys in some hash enumerator
  one by one.
- fixed a bug with mouse wheels scrolling in scrollers even with the widget
  fully visible.
- Fixed a memory leak (the destroy function for a view was never called and
  as a result the shaded windows didn't go away when closed. The non-shaded
  windows were unmapped on close but not destroyed either so they only
  apparently went away, but continued to use memory).



changes since wmaker 0.62.0:
............................
- added WMSetWidgetDefaultFont(), WMSetWidgetDefaultBoldFont()



changes since wmaker 0.62.0:
............................

- added drag and drop
- changed selection code
- added clientdata to WMFindInBag
- removed SetWindowInitialSize()
- added SetWindowAspectRatio()

- added WMSetConnectionDefaultTimeout() and WMSetConnectionOpenTimeout();
- added WMGetConnectionTimeoutState()

changes since wmaker 0.61.1:
............................

- WARNING: semantic of bags has changed!
	An index assigned to an item will always keep that index unless
	you insert an item before it.

	For example:
		bag = WMCreateBag();
		WMSetInBag(bag, 10, "bla");
	That code will put "bla" in index 10, instead of 0, as it used to be.
- fixed WMInsertInBag(). It ignored index, and always put the new item at end.
- added WMSaveUserDefaults().
- rewrote WMPopUpButton to use WMMenuItem
- added WMGetPopUpButtonMenuItem(WMPopUpButton *bPtr, int index)
- WMSortListItemsWithComparer(WMList *lPtr, (int)(f)(const void*, const void*))
- WMSortBrowserColumnWithComparer()
- fixed bug with sorting list items.
- fixed bug in handling keyboard input associated with selection and
  notification sending.
- filepanel puts dirs on top of list (Wolff <wolff@cybercable.fr>)
- added WMReplaceInBag (Wolff <wolff@cybercable.fr>)
- added vertical views and multiple views in WMSplitView (Wolff <wolff@cybercable.fr>)
- changed values of parameter values of WMSplitViewConstrainProc()
- configurable default fontsize patch (Igor P. Roboul <igor@mordor.myip.org>)
- fixed a bug that crashed the programm when a popup button was scrolled.
- fixed a bug that caused incorrect drawing position of the popup indicator.
- fixed a bug that prevented selecting no item (-1) in a popup button.
- an assertion will be raised if the program tries to select a popup button
  item that is beyond the total number of items present in the popup button.
- changed names of functions for SplitView to be consistent. Some contained
  SubView while other Subview. Now all have Subview.
- fixed a bug in how input events were posted. Establishing 2 or more input 
  handlers for the same file descriptor, handling different (read/write/except)
  events, caused wrong handlers to be called.
- Reimplemented the input and idle handlers with WMBag to avoid a functional
  problem with them: inability to remove handlers next to the called one, from
  the called handler itself. Trying to do this with the old version caused the
  program to crash.
- changed wrealloc behaviour to be like this: new = wrealloc(old, new_size);
    1. if old is NULL, return wmalloc(new_size).
    2. if new_size is 0, call wfree(old), and return NULL.
    3. if both old is a valid pointer and new_size>0, call realloc.
- added wstrerror(int errnum) to return the string associated with errnum.
- new wsyserrorwithcode(int error, const char* fmt, ...), similar to 
  wsyserror(), but printing the message for the specified error code.
- added 3 new classes: WMData, WMHost and WMConnection
- fixed a big memory leak in the color panel code (from Pascal Hofstee).
- added scrolling to tabview

changes since wmaker 0.61.0:
............................

- escape key in panels (craig nellist <crn@ozemail.com.au>)
- applied patch with fixes and enhancements to textfield 
	(Franck Wolff <wolff@cybercable.fr>)
- changed WMList to use WMBag internally, instead of a linked list
- replaced WMAddSortedListItem() with WMSortListItems()
- replaced WMAddSortedBrowserItem() with WMSortBrowserColumn()

changes since wmaker 0.60.0:
............................

- added WMScreenWidth() and WMScreenHeight() functions.
- fixed some problems when compiling with non gcc compilers.
- added WMSetTextFieldFont()
- added WMSetButtonImageDefault() (craig nellist <crn@ozemail.com.au>)
- added WMBag (array/list)
- added libWUtil, a library that is a subset of libWINGs. It contains utils
  that can be used in writing non-GUI programs. They include: hashes,
  notifications, input/idle/timer handlers, user defaults database handling,
  memory handling, application resource handling, etc.
  All the non-GUI stuff from libWINGs is present.
  Still linWINGs contain all this stuff so if you use libWINGs, you don't
  need to link against libWUtil too.
  One notable aspect of libWUtil is that it has a modified version of the
  event handling function. It is named WHandleEvents() and will handle all
  input/idle/timer events the app has.
  If your app has a permanent input handler (as for example a socket a server
  is listening on), then the main loop of the app can be:
  	while(1) {
    	    WHandleEvents();
  	}
  but if there is no permanent input handler, you need to add some delay to
  avoid a too high cpu load by your program:
  	while(1) {
            WHandleEvents();
            wusleep(5000);
        }
  A permanent input handler is one that is established when the program starts
  and is present until the program exits.
  One that is deleted and later reinstalled, is not considered permanent.
  This difference is because if there is some input handler, the function will
  block until some event appears, while if there is no input handler the
  function will return almost immediately (after handling the timer/idle
  stuff).

  Except the stuff declared in WUtil.h, the following functions declared in
  WINGs.h are also present in libWUtil (you will need to #include <WINGs.h>
  if you use one of these):
	WMInitializeApplication(char *applicationName, int *argc, char **argv);
	WMSetResourcePath(char *path);
	WMGetApplicationName();
	WMPathForResourceOfType(char *resource, char *ext);
	WMAddTimerHandler(int milliseconds, WMCallback *callback, void *cdata);
	WMDeleteTimerWithClientData(void *cdata);
	WMDeleteTimerHandler(WMHandlerID handlerID);
	WMAddIdleHandler(WMCallback *callback, void *cdata);
	WMDeleteIdleHandler(WMHandlerID handlerID);
	WMAddInputHandler(int fd, int condition, WMInputProc *proc,
        		  void *clientData);
	WMDeleteInputHandler(WMHandlerID handlerID);
- added progress indicator widget
- Changed WMSetWindowUPosition() and WMSetWindowUSize() to
  WMSetWindowInitialPosition() and WMSetWindowInitialSize() respectively,
  for better naming conventions.


changes since wmaker 0.53.0:
............................

- added balloon help
- fixed a bug with setting initial path in browsers.
- added WMSetButtonImageDimsWhenDisabled()
- changed simple callback/notifications to delegate-like stuff. Affected
  widgets are:
  	WMBrowser
	- WMSetBrowserFillProc() was replaced with WMSetBrowserDelegate
	- WMBrowserDidScrollNotification was replaced with a delegate callback

	WMTextField (not completed yet)
	The notifications will still work, but using the delegate is preferable

  How to convert old code to delegate callbacks:
  	1 - create a variable (static or dynamic) of the type of the 
	    delegate for the widget type.
	2 - Replace the notification observers with the equivalent 
	    delegate callbacks. 
	3 - Put pointers to the callbacks in the delegate variable.

	Take a look in wfilepanel.c to see how it is used there.

- changed W_ViewProcedureTable to delegates
	This will only affect user created widgets. If you have a custom
	widget, you will need to update the callbacks and the declaration
	of the W_ViewProcedureTable variable to be a W_ViewDelegate,
	which is declared in WINGsP.h  To setup the delegate, assign
	the delegate variable to view->delegate.

- WMTextField
	Removed all the didChange notifications that were sent when the text
	was changed programmatically. Only changes made by user interaction
	will be notified now. If you need the old behaviour, send notifications
	manually when you change the text.

- added WMTabView
- added WMGetColorPanelColor(WMColorPanel *panel)
- made WMGetUDStringForKey() to only return a reference to the string, not a
  wstrdup()'ed copy. DO NOT FREE IT ANYMORE!
- added MultiByteText option to userdefaults file to control use of multibyte
  string drawing functions
- renamed WMCreateFont() to WMCreateFontSet()
- renamed WMCreateFontInDefaultEncoding() to WMCreateNormalFont()

This is a python wrapper for the WINGs library. With it you can write python
based programs which will have WINGs based graphic interfaces.

This module in not built by default. To build it you need python2.1 or later
and swig-1.3.14 or later.

To build it, first compile and install WINGs. after that run 'make' in this
directory. 'make install' will install the python module into the python tree.

run test.py or even WINGs.py for an example.

the code is not yet finished and probably won't do everything you expect it
to do.

Note: currently the module expects WINGs installed to build. it won't take
the WINGs libraries and header files from the source tree. You need to
install WINGs first. Even if an old version of WINGs is already installed,
you still need to nstall the newly built WINGs, else the python module will
be built against the old version

Description
===========

WindowMaker is a window manager designed to emulate the look and feel of
part of the NEXTSTEP(tm) GUI. It's supposed to be relatively fast and small,
feature rich, easy to configure and easy to use, with a simple and elegant
appearance borrowed from NEXTSTEP(tm).


User Guide
==========

The WindowMaker User's Guide can be downloaded from the official ftp
or web sites.
It can also be viewed in HTML format in:
http://people.delphi.com/crc3419/WMUserGuide/index.htm


Directories & Files

o INSTALL contains installation instructions and some troubleshooting tips.

o Install is a script for configuring and compiling WindowMaker in a easy
way.

o ChangeLog contains the changes since the last version

o BUGS contains a list of the currently known bugs

o FAQ is a list of frequently asked questions. Read it. I won't answer 
questions answered in it.

o NEWS is a list of user visible changes since the last version. Read it if
you are upgrading.

o wmlib/ contains the library necessary to write applications that use
WindowMaker specific features, like application defined menus. This library
will be merged into WINGs in the future.

o WINGs/ contain the WINGs (WINGs Is Not GNUstep) tiny widget library. It is
used by wmaker, but can be used by standalone programs as well.

o test/ contains a simple test program that shows some of the things that can
be done with WindowMaker and wmlib

o wrlib/ contains the library used to do image manipulation (loading,
dithering etc.) in WindowMaker. It can be used in other applications.

o util/ contains various utility programs.

o WPrefs/ contains the source code for the WindowMaker Preferences utility.
Read the WPrefs/README file before using it.

o Configuration options can be found in the ~/GNUstep/Defaults/* files
(after installation). The menus can be configured in
~/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/menu

o The default configuration files for the system are installed by default in
/usr/local/share/WindowMaker, along with some other data files.

o src/wconfig.h contains various compile time options you can change to
select some options/features and things like the path for configuration
directory.

o BUGFORM is a form you should fill to send a bugreport. Please use the
form. It makes things easier to me and ensures that you give me a reasonable
amount of information. This form should be sent to developers@windowmaker.org


Mailing List
============

There is a mailing list for discussing WindowMaker at
wmaker@linuxcenter.com To subscribe to it, send a message containing:
	subscribe 
in the subject and the body of the message to wmaker-request@linuxcenter.com

If you have some problem installing or using wmaker, it would be advisable
to ask in the mailing list, as the probability of at least one of the 500+
users there having the same problem as you (and solving it) is bigger than
the three of us. The developers are subscribed to the mailing list, so we
will read your post anyway (no need for cc:). For bug reports, fill
the BUGFORM and send it to developers@windowmaker.org  You can also use
the bug tracker page at http://windowmaker.org/cgi-bin/bugs

Important note: when asking for help (in the mailing list or to the 
developerts, directly) always send information about the system you are
using. You can use the system information section at the end of BUGFORM
as a guideline. Another thing: please don't send HTML mail. You will
be risking having your mail deleted before being read. Not everybody
uses a browser to read email, wich makes your message an annoyance.
There should be an option in your mail app to disable it.



Running multiple instances of WindowMaker
=========================================

It is not a good idea to run more than one instance of WindowMaker
from the same user (so that wmaker will use the same configuration
files) at the same time. You might get unexpected behaviour when WindowMaker
updates it's configuration files.


Sound support
=============

Sound is supported for Linux and FreeBSD systems with the use of a
separately distributed module. You can download it at:
http://www.frontiernet.net/~southgat/wmsound

Note that you must compile WindowMaker with the --enable-sound configure
flag and set the DisableSound option to NO.


Performance Tuning
==================

If you want to diminish WindowMaker's memory usage and improve performance,
while keeping a nice appearance and good functionality, follow the items
bellow:

- use solid textures for everything, mainly titlebars and menus. If you
  want a nice looking desktop, use the Traditional style.
- turn NewStyle and Superfluous off
- turn on DisableAnimations
- do not bind many shortcuts in the menu and keep only the essential items
  in the menu
- turn on DisableClip
- edit wconfig.h and disable the NUMLOCK_HACK and the features you
  don't use anyway (keep in mind that some of the #defines might not
  work, as they are not fully supported). Make sure to always keep
  NumLock and ScrollLock turned off.
- strip down the default IconPath and PixmapPath entries to contain only 
  the paths that you really have in your system. 
- do not use large images in the root background
- remove support for image formats you don't use

Musicware
=========

If you use WindowMaker and *really* like it, please consider making my day
by sending me a music CD (or a MiniDisc) of your favorite band, singer,
instrumentist, composer or whatever :^). I like listening to music and would
love to get new CDs, especially from other parts of the world. I like almost
any kind of music, from Ozzy Osbourne to Bach (mas não pagode e sertanejo
pelamordideus :), so I will be happy to receive just about anything.

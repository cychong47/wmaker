Do ASAP:
========
- fix bestvisual selection code. Broken.
- add a dialog to let user choose if we should restart, restart twm or continue crashing on crash. Do not forget to check if wmaker is already fully running.
- fix stacking. buggy again (maybe XFree 3.2 bug)
- fix RemakeStackList() to account for transient windows
- differential update of appmenu
- make unhide app map windows in the same stacking order they were before
hiding

Need to do:
===========
- support for X11R6.4 extension for getting extra visual info in wrlib's
  automatic best context guessing
- ICCCM 2.0 stuff (although nobody is 2.0 compliant, AFAIK. Not even twm)
- rewrite menu traversal code
- histeresys in menu item selection
- docklet to control AccessX (keyboard accessibility) functions
- rewrite all redundant stuff to use WINGs
- resizebartexture option
- add function to directly make a thumbnail of an image, using the
  functionality provided by the image libraries to load a minimal
  amount of data.
+ investigate memory leaks 
- make Docked apps with WM_CLIENT_MACHINE be launched from respective
	machines (also put a marking showing it's remote launched)
- rewrite defaults/wdefaults stuff to use WINGs UD stuff. Search list:
  ~/G/D/WindowMaker /u/l/s/W/D/WindowMaker built-in-defaults
- remake internal string processing to use wchar? unicode?
- -stateprefix cmd arg to specify sufix for WMState domain (multiple instance
	support)
- R6 style session management (or something to make wmaker compatible/aware 
  of it)


Maybe some day:
===============
- virtual workspace
- optimize for size
- make dithering in 8bpp better


Never: (so, dont even bother to ask)
======
- different themes for each workspace. Unless you give us a SGI/Power Onyx
with 2 CPUs ;). Different workspacebacks for each workspace is being
considered, but don't hold your breath.
- anything that requires the mouse pointer to be jumped by WindowMaker to
somewhere. This is *terrible* behaviour. And it's not just IMO.

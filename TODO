Do ASAP:
========
- fix bestvisual selection code. Broken.
- fix RemakeStackList() to account for transient windows
- blink border of clients with UrgencyHint set between red and black
- finish session stuff
- fix scroller to not jump while dragging knob
- add multiline support for balloons
- move/add balloon to WINGs
- finish XStandardColormap stuff in wrlib
- finish menu editor/other stuff in wprefs

Need to do:
===========
- put a "Do not save workspace state" in the exit confirmation dialog
- allow user to select/restore default root menu from wprefs
- fix windoze cycle window patch
- support for X11R6.4 extension for getting extra visual info in wrlib's
  automatic best context guessing
- docklet to control AccessX (keyboard accessibility) functions
- rewrite all redundant stuff to use WINGs
- resizebartexture option
- add function to directly make a thumbnail of an image, using the
  functionality provided by the image libraries to load a minimal
  amount of data.
+ investigate memory leaks 
- rewrite defaults/wdefaults stuff to use WINGs UD stuff. Search list:
  ~/G/D/WindowMaker /u/l/s/W/D/WindowMaker built-in-defaults
- remake internal string processing to use wchar? unicode?
- add new file for stuff like default commands and dnd commands for
docked apps, balloons for the dock etc
- alpha-channel app specified icons 

Maybe some day:
===============
- virtual workspace
- optimize for size


Never: (so, dont even bother to ask)
======
- different themes for each workspace. Unless you give us a SGI/Power Onyx
with 2 CPUs ;). 
- anything that requires the mouse pointer to be jumped by WindowMaker to
somewhere. This is *terrible* behaviour. And it's not just IMO.


- ICCCM 2.0: ICCCM 2.0 (not 1.0, which is what everybody supports so so) is
a relatively new standard and nobody, AFAIK, complies with it (not even
twm as people tend to think). It has some neat things, but many of the new
stuff is really weird and tricky to implement, not to say unworthy (read the
specs and you'll see). This is not bad, since I think it is very unlikely
that a client that requires it exists... Anyway, if we get an "official"
sample implementation (twm?) it might be supported. Maybe dtwm supports
it? I dont know...
